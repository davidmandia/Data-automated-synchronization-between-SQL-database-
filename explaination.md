```python
import mysql.connector
from mysql.connector import errorcode
import time
import logging
from threading import Thread
```

- **Imports**: 
  - `mysql.connector`: This module provides an interface to connect to MySQL databases from Python.
  - `errorcode`: This is a sub-module of `mysql.connector` that helps handle specific MySQL error codes.
  - `time`: Used for implementing delays, particularly useful in retry logic.
  - `logging`: This module is used to create log files to track the script's execution, which is crucial for debugging and monitoring.
  - `Thread`: This is used to handle concurrent operations, such as simulating concurrent updates to the database.

```python
# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='sync_log.log', level=logging.INFO,
                    format='%(asctime)s:%(levelname)s:%(message)s')
```

- **Logging Configuration**:
  - `filename='sync_log.log'`: Specifies the log file where all logs will be stored.
  - `level=logging.INFO`: Sets the logging level to `INFO`, which means it will capture all log messages from INFO level and above (including ERROR, WARNING).
  - `format`: Defines the format of log messages. Here, it includes the timestamp, log level, and the actual log message.

```python
def connect_to_database(host, user, password, database):
    """Establish a connection to the MySQL database with retry logic."""
    attempts = 3
    while attempts > 0:
        try:
            connection = mysql.connector.connect(
                host=host,
                user=user,
                password=password,
                database=database
            )
            logging.info(f"Connected to {database} at {host}")
            return connection
        except mysql.connector.Error as err:
            logging.error(f"Error connecting to {database} at {host}: {err}")
            if attempts > 1:
                logging.info(f"Retrying connection to {database}...")
                time.sleep(5)
            attempts -= 1
    return None
```

- **Database Connection Function**:
  - **Purpose**: To establish a connection to a MySQL database. It includes retry logic in case the initial connection attempt fails.
  - `attempts = 3`: Limits the number of retries to 3.
  - `try-except block`: Attempts to connect to the database and handles any connection errors.
  - `logging`: Logs successful connections or errors, including retries.
  - `time.sleep(5)`: Adds a 5-second delay between retries.

```python
def execute_sql_file(connection, sql_file):
    """Execute an SQL file to create tables and populate data."""
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        with open(sql_file, 'r') as file:
            sql = file.read()
            for result in cursor.execute(sql, multi=True):
                if result.with_rows:
                    result.fetchall()  # Fetch all rows if it's a SELECT query
                logging.info(f"Executed: {result.statement}")
        connection.commit()
        logging.info(f"Executed SQL file: {sql_file}")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Failed to execute SQL file {sql_file}: {e}")
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

- **SQL File Execution Function**:
  - **Purpose**: To execute a provided SQL file that contains commands to create tables and insert initial data into the database.
  - `cursor.execute(sql, multi=True)`: Executes multiple SQL statements from the file.
  - `commit()`: Commits the transaction after executing the SQL file to save changes.
  - `logging`: Logs each statement executed and any errors encountered.

```python
def synchronize_tables(conn1, conn2, table_name):
    """Synchronize data between two tables with the same schema."""
    cursor1 = conn1.cursor(dictionary=True)
    cursor2 = conn2.cursor(dictionary=True)

    try:
        logging.info(f"Synchronizing table {table_name} from database1 to database2...")
        # Retrieve data from both tables
        cursor1.execute(f"SELECT * FROM {table_name}")
        records1 = cursor1.fetchall()

        cursor2.execute(f"SELECT * FROM {table_name}")
        records2 = cursor2.fetchall()

        records1_dict = {record['pkey']: record for record in records1}
        records2_dict = {record['pkey']: record for record in records2}

        # Insert/update records
        for pkey, record in records1_dict.items():
            if pkey not in records2_dict:
                placeholders = ', '.join(['%s'] * len(record))
                columns = ', '.join(record.keys())
                sql = f"INSERT INTO {table_name} ({columns}) VALUES ({placeholders})"
                cursor2.execute(sql, list(record.values()))
                logging.info(f"Inserted new record with pkey {pkey} into {table_name}.")
            elif record != records2_dict[pkey]:
                updates = ', '.join([f"{col}=%s" for col in record.keys()])
                sql = f"UPDATE {table_name} SET {updates} WHERE pkey=%s"
                cursor2.execute(sql, list(record.values()) + [pkey])
                logging.info(f"Updated record with pkey {pkey} in {table_name}.")

        # Delete records
        for pkey in records2_dict.keys():
            if pkey not in records1_dict:
                sql = f"DELETE FROM {table_name} WHERE pkey=%s"
                cursor2.execute(sql, (pkey,))
                logging.info(f"Deleted record with pkey {pkey} from {table_name}.")

        conn2.commit()
        logging.info(f"Synchronized table: {table_name}")
    except mysql.connector.Error as err:
        logging.error(f"Error during synchronization of table {table_name}: {err}")
    finally:
        cursor1.close()
        cursor2.close()
```

- **Table Synchronization Function**:
  - **Purpose**: To synchronize data between two tables with the same schema from two different databases.
  - `dictionary=True`: Fetches the result as a dictionary to easily compare records.
  - **Steps**:
    1. **Retrieve Data**: Fetches all records from the table in both databases.
    2. **Insert/Update Records**: 
       - If a record in `conn1` does not exist in `conn2`, it is inserted.
       - If a record exists in both but differs, it is updated.
    3. **Delete Records**: Deletes records that exist in `conn2` but not in `conn1`.
  - `conn2.commit()`: Commits changes to `conn2` after synchronization.
  - `logging`: Tracks each synchronization step, including inserts, updates, and deletions.

```python
def close_connection(connection):
    """Close the database connection."""
    if connection:
        connection.close()
        logging.info("Database connection closed.")
```

- **Close Connection Function**:
  - **Purpose**: Ensures that database connections are properly closed to avoid any resource leaks.
  - `logging`: Logs that the connection has been closed.

```python
def populate_large_dataset(connection, table_name, record_count):
    """Populate a table with a large number of records for testing."""
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        logging.info(f"Populating {record_count} records in {table_name}...")
        for i in range(record_count):
            sql = f"INSERT INTO {table_name} (compoundid, preferredname, smiles) VALUES ('Compound{i}', 'Test{i}', 'C{i}H{i}')"
            cursor.execute(sql)
        connection.commit()
        logging.info(f"Populated {record_count} records in {table_name}")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Failed to populate large dataset in {table_name}: {e}")
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

- **Large Dataset Population Function**:
  - **Purpose**: To populate a table with a large number of records, useful for testing performance and scalability.
  - **Loop**: Inserts `record_count` number of records into the specified table.
  - `logging`: Logs the start and completion of the dataset population.

```python
def simulate_concurrent_updates(connection, table_name):
    """Simulate concurrent updates to the database."""
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        logging.info(f"Simulating concurrent update on {table_name}...")
        sql = f"UPDATE {table_name} SET assay_type = 'Updated Type' WHERE pkey = 1"
        cursor.execute(sql)
        connection.commit()
        logging.info(f"Concurrent update performed on {table_name}")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error during concurrent update simulation on {table_name}: {e}")
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

- **Concurrent Updates Simulation Function**:
  - **Purpose**: To simulate concurrent updates to the database to test how the synchronization handles such situations.
  - **Update Operation**: Updates a specific row in the `assay` table.
  - `logging`: Logs the attempt and result of the concurrent update.

```python
# Example connection details (replace with actual credentials)
db_config1 = {
    "host": "localhost",
    "user": "root",
    "password": "password",
    "database": "database1"
}

db_config2 = {
    "host": "localhost",
    "user": "root",
    "password": "password",
    "database": "database2"
}
```

- **Database Configuration**:
  - `db_config1` and `db_config2`: Store connection details for two databases. These

 should be replaced with actual database credentials.

```python
# Main script execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    conn1 = connect_to_database(**db_config1)
    conn2 = connect_to_database(**db_config2)

    if conn1 and conn2:
        execute_sql_file(conn1, "data/dump-database1.sql")
        execute_sql_file(conn2, "data/dump-database2.sql")

        synchronize_tables(conn1, conn2, "target")
        synchronize_tables(conn1, conn2, "compounds")
        synchronize_tables(conn1, conn2, "assay")

        # Simulate large dataset and concurrent updates
        populate_large_dataset(conn1, "compounds", 1000)
        thread1 = Thread(target=simulate_concurrent_updates, args=(conn2, "assay"))
        thread2 = Thread(target=simulate_concurrent_updates, args=(conn2, "assay"))
        thread1.start()
        thread2.start()
        thread1.join()
        thread2.join()

        close_connection(conn1)
        close_connection(conn2)
    else:
        logging.error("Failed to connect to one or both databases.")
```

- **Main Execution Block**:
  - **Connect to Databases**: Establishes connections to both databases.
  - **SQL File Execution**: Executes the SQL files to set up the databases.
  - **Synchronization**: Calls the synchronization function for each table (`target`, `compounds`, `assay`).
  - **Simulations**: Populates the database with a large dataset and simulates concurrent updates using threads.
  - **Close Connections**: Ensures all database connections are closed after operations are completed.
  - `else`: Logs an error if the connection to one or both databases fails.
